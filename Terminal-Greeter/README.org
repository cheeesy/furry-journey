#+TITLE: Terminal-Greeter for Bash

** Description
   Terminal-Greeter is a script that greets the user everytime they open a terminal.
   Out-of-the-box the script will greet you with a box containing the phrase "GNU/Linux".
*** Installation
    Run *install.sh* or manually do the necessary steps.

*** Customization
    Terminal-Greeter uses a file called *.gnu* which contains the majority of the greeting.
    If you want a different greeting text, you'll need to change the text.

** Future features
*** TODO Add option to use the distro name & version as a greeting text
   SCHEDULED: As soon as possible
   
   I'm not sure whether this will work with the box-drawing-characters, but hopefully it will.
   I think that this will need an additional program to work, and a rewrite of *install.sh*.
